## How to Install Haskell in Linux

To install Haskell on a Linux system, you can use a package manager like `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`, depending on your Linux distribution. Haskell is typically available through these package managers, and it's the recommended way to install Haskell to ensure that you have the latest stable version. Here are instructions for some common Linux distributions:

1. **Debian/Ubuntu**:

   Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install haskell-platform
   ```

## GHCI

 ```text
 All done!

To start a simple repl, run:
  ghci

To start a new haskell project in the current directory, run:
  cabal init --interactive

To install other GHC versions and tools, run:
  ghcup tui

## Course

1. **What is functional programming and how does it differ from imperative programming?**
   - This question sets the foundational understanding of the programming paradigms.

2. **Can you explain the basic syntax of Haskell?**
   - Understanding the syntax is crucial for writing any Haskell program.

3. **How do you define and use functions in Haskell?**
   - Since Haskell is a functional language, understanding functions is key.

4. **What are data types in Haskell, and how do you use them?**
   - Knowing how to define and use different data types is essential.

5. **Can you provide an example of simple input and output operations in Haskell?**
   - This helps in understanding how to interact with users in a Haskell program.

6. **What are lists in Haskell, and how do you manipulate them?**
   - Lists are fundamental in Haskell and are used in many different contexts.

7. **How do you implement conditional logic and loops in Haskell?**
   - Understanding control structures like if-else and loops (though in Haskell, loops are often handled differently, e.g., using recursion).

8. **Can you show me how to write a simple function that performs basic arithmetic operations?**
   - This is a stepping stone to building a calculator.

9. **What is recursion in Haskell, and how do you use it in a program?**
   - Since iteration in the traditional sense is not common in Haskell, recursion is a key concept.

10. **How do you handle errors or exceptions in Haskell?**
    - Essential for writing robust programs.

11. **What are higher-order functions, and can you provide examples?**
    - This is a core concept in Haskell and functional programming in general.

12. **Can you explain what monads are in Haskell with a simple example?**
    - While advanced, understanding monads is crucial for Haskell.

13. **How do you read from and write to files in Haskell?**
    - Necessary for data processing applications.

14. **Can you guide me through creating a simple text-based calculator in Haskell?**
    - This would be an integrative project combining many of the earlier concepts.

15. **How can I extend the calculator to include additional features like handling more complex expressions or storing history?**
    - This introduces more advanced programming concepts.

16. **Can you help me build a basic data processing application that reads from a CSV file and performs simple analytics?**
    - This is a practical application of Haskell that brings together many aspects of the language.
