## How to Install Haskell in Linux

To install Haskell on a Linux system, you can use a package manager like `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`, depending on your Linux distribution. Haskell is typically available through these package managers, and it's the recommended way to install Haskell to ensure that you have the latest stable version. Here are instructions for some common Linux distributions:

1. **Debian/Ubuntu**:

   Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install haskell-platform
   ```

## GHCI

 ```text
 All done!

To start a simple repl, run:
  ghci

To start a new haskell project in the current directory, run:
  cabal init --interactive

To install other GHC versions and tools, run:
  ghcup tui
